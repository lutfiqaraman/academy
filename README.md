The program is doing the following
  1. A login page
  2. A logout page
  3. A register form for a new user
  4. A page that has a link for a course, I name it 'cards.html'
  5. A page that has a course file, I name it 'htmlcourse.html'
  6. A facebook login using Oauth 2.0

The register form has 
  1. User name
  2. Email
  3. Password
  
Technology used to do that:
  1. Node js
  2. Angular js
  3. Html5
  4. Bootstrap 3.7
  5. MongoDb
  6. OAuth 2.0
  
When a new user is successfully registered, the data is saved in a database type of 'nosql', I used mongodb. It also checked if the user is already registered or not. The app is also provide a profile access. The register form also provide a link for a fb regsiteration, I only do fb authentication as a sample, Oauth is used to do that.
